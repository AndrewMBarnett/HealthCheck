# HealthCheck

Health Check is a script to update progress with swiftDialog including Inventory, Policy Check In, Jamf Protect Check In

This project is heavily inspired from Dan Snelson's project ([Inventory Update Progress](https://snelson.us/2024/02/inventory-update-progress-2/))

Leveraging Bart Reardon's swiftDialog ([swiftDialog](https://github.com/swiftDialog/swiftDialog)) you can show progress windows for things including: Jamf Inventory, Jamf Policy Check In, and Jamf Protect Check In. You can also individually call the commands if you don't want to run all of them together at once.
